<b>Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!</b>   
I created this space to showcase hands-on work I’ve done while studying and working in cybersecurity from compliance mapping to risk assessments to security policy writing. Everything here is part of my journey from sales pro to security analyst, with a focus on clarity, strategy, and getting better 1% every day.

<h2>🚀 Featured Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>⚙️ Compliance Matrix: NIST vs ISO vs CMMC</b>  
    <br>
    I built a side-by-side matrix to visualize how three core cybersecurity frameworks align. This helped me understand how different organizations manage controls based on industry and regulation.

    <b>🧠 Mock Risk Assessment: POS System</b>  
    <br>
    A breakdown of risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies for a retail Point-of-Sale system. Built like I’d present it to a real team — practical, prioritized, and mapped to impact.

    <b>🗂️ Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</b>  
    <br>
    My take on a clear, concise, and human-friendly Acceptable Use Policy. Written from scratch with new employees in mind — and a tone that actually encourages compliance.
