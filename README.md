<b>Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!</b>   
I created this space to showcase hands-on work I’ve done while studying and working in cybersecurity from compliance mapping to risk assessments to security policy writing. Everything here is part of my journey from AE to security analyst, with a focus on clarity, strategy, and getting better 1% every day.

<h2>🚀 Featured Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>⚙️ Compliance Matrix: NIST vs ISO vs CMMC</b>  
    <br>
    I built a side-by-side matrix to visualize how three core cybersecurity frameworks align. This helped me understand how different organizations manage controls based on industry and regulation.

    <b>🧠 Mock Risk Assessment: POS System</b>  
    <br>
    A breakdown of risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies for a retail Point-of-Sale system. Built like I’d present it to a real team — practical, prioritized, and mapped to impact.

  <li>
    <b>🗂️ Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</b>  
    <br>
    My take on a clear, concise, and human-friendly Acceptable Use Policy. Written from scratch with new employees in mind — and a tone that actually encourages compliance.

    <b>📋 Controls and Compliance Assessment</b>  
    <br>
    A hands-on internal audit simulation using the NIST CSF. I evaluated asset management, risk posture, and compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards — then documented key findings and recommendations.

    <b>🧠 Home Lab: Security Operations Center (SOC)</b>  
    <br>
    A self-built SOC environment to practice log analysis, detection rule writing, and endpoint monitoring. This project helped me apply SIEM workflows, threat detection, and response techniques in a controlled lab setting.

  <li>
    <b>☁️ Microsoft Azure Lab Projects</b>  
    <br>
    Built and configured a hybrid Active Directory environment inside Azure. Explored NSG rules, firewall behavior, and how cloud infrastructure impacts identity, access, and security monitoring.
